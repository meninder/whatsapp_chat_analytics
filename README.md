# Get Analytic Graphs of Your Whatsapp Chats

After downloading your [chat history from WhatsApp] (https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/wp/22548236), you can run the Jupyter Notebook to get graphs showing:
1. Number of messages by person
2. Word cloud showing people in chat in proportion to number of messages
3. Sentiment of the chat through time.
4. Total number of messages per day.
5. Several more will be added...

To show how the code works and not use a personal chat of mine, I created a chat file using Tolstoy's War and Peace:
